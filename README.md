# 🎓 SkillBridge

### *The Bridge Between Academia and Industry — Rebuilt from the Ground Up*

**A centralized, blockchain-verified portal for intelligent opportunity discovery, skill-gap analysis, and end-to-end academic project lifecycle management.**

[🚀 Live Demo](#) · [📹 Video Walkthrough](#) · [📄 Docs](#architecture)

</div>

## 📌 Problem Statement

> *The bridge between academia and industry is currently fragmented. Internship opportunities are scattered across siloed job boards, and academic projects often lack real-world relevance because students cannot easily find industry mentors or datasets. There is a significant skills gap mismatch, and recruiters struggle to verify the authentic contribution of students in group-based academic work.*

**AcadLedger** is our answer to this challenge — a unified, AI-powered, blockchain-verified platform that closes the academia-industry gap at every stage of a student's career journey.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Create a **centralized, blockchain-verified portal** for:
- 🔍 Intelligent, skill-based opportunity discovery
- 📊 Automated skill-gap analysis with AI
- 🗂️ End-to-end project and application lifecycle management
- 🤝 Transparent, verifiable student-recruiter collaboration

---

## ✅ Expected Outcomes (How We Deliver Them)

| Expected Outcome | AcadLedger Implementation |
|---|---|
| Skill-based, hyper-personalized opportunity matching using NLP-driven resume-to-JD parsing | **AI Resume Analyzer** — GPT-4 class LLM parses resumes against JDs, produces ATS scores, keyword gap analysis, and section-by-section feedback |
| Simplified, transparent application tracking and milestone management | **Recruiter ATS Kanban Board** — drag-and-drop pipeline with status: `pending → reviewing → shortlisted → hired/rejected` |
| Strengthened industry-academia collaboration through co-sponsored projects | **Recruiter Postings Portal** — recruiters publish skill-tagged opportunities; students apply directly within the platform |
| Higher student placement rates and verifiable digital project portfolios | **Blockchain-Verified Profiles** — SHA-256 hashed academic portfolios with Git-scraper integration for authentic contribution tracking |

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Resume Analyzer
- Upload resume PDF → select a Job Description → get instant AI analysis
- Returns: **ATS Score (0–100)**, matched/missing keywords, **skill gap breakdown** (technical, tools, soft), section-level feedback, improved bullet points, and a shortlist verdict
- **Multi-model fallback chain** (Gemini 2.5 Flash → Llama 4 → Gemini 2.0 → DeepSeek → Llama 3.3 → Qwen3) via OpenRouter — zero downtime even under rate limits
- PDF text extraction with `pdf-parse`; truncation safety for large resumes

### 🕷️ Git Scraper — Authentic Contribution Tracking
- Scrapes public GitHub repositories linked to academic projects
- Extracts commit history, file-level contributions, and PR/issue activity
- Maps contributions **per-student** in group projects — solving the "free rider" problem
- Results are hashed and stored as verifiable blockchain records

### 🔗 Blockchain-Verified Portfolios (SHA-256)
- Every academic milestone, test score, project contribution, and certification is hashed using **SHA-256**
- Hash is stored on-chain, making credentials **tamper-evident and independently verifiable**
- Recruiters can one-click verify any student's portfolio authenticity
- Eliminates resume fraud and ghostwritten project submissions

### 📋 Recruiter ATS Kanban Board
- Full drag-and-drop Kanban (`pending → applied → reviewing → shortlisted → rejected → hired`) built with `@dnd-kit`
- Optimistic UI updates with server-side sync
- Applicant detail drawer with resume, cover letter, and profile
- Bulk status management, search, and filter

### 📢 Opportunity Posting & Discovery
- Recruiters create structured postings: skills required, stipend, duration, location/remote, deadline, max applications
- **Optional skill gate**: attach a proctored test that candidates must pass before applying
- Students browse and filter opportunities matched to their verified skill profile

### 🧪 Proctored Skill Assessment Engine
- Recruiters build dynamic MCQ tests (single correct, multiple correct, true/false)
- Features: shuffle questions/options, strict mode (tab-switch detection), configurable time limits, negative marking
- Server-side auto-grading via PostgreSQL stored procedures (`grade_attempt_v2`)
- Session resume — if a student loses connection, they pick up exactly where they left off

### 📈 Analytics Dashboards
- **Recruiter dashboard**: live/upcoming/past tests, total attempts, draft stats, placement rates
- **Candidate dashboard**: completed tests, available opportunities, ATS score history, skill progress

### 👤 Dual-Role Architecture
- `candidate` — Students with academic profiles, skill tests, resume uploads, applications
- `recruiter` — Companies/institutions with test creation, postings, ATS pipeline, analytics

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pushkar2510/AcadLedger.git
cd AcadLedger

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

### Environment Variables

```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# AI (OpenRouter)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key

cd git-scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# Scraper API runs at http://localhost:5000
```

## 🔐 Security & Trust Architecture

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
Every database table is protected by PostgreSQL RLS policies — users can only access their own data. Recruiters cannot see other recruiters' candidates; candidates cannot see other candidates' applications.

### Proctoring
- Tab-switch detection with server-recorded `tab_switch_count`
- Strict mode locks the browser viewport
- Server-side expiry: if a student's timer runs out, the attempt is auto-submitted and graded server-side via a stored procedure — no client-side manipulation possible

### Blockchain Verification (SHA-256)
```
Student completes milestone
        ↓
Platform serializes: { student_id, milestone_type, result, timestamp }
        ↓
SHA-256 hash generated on server
        ↓
Hash stored in `blockchain_records` table
        ↓
Recruiter verifies: recomputes hash from public data → compare → ✅ or ❌
```

This makes every score, certificate, and project contribution **independently verifiable** without trusting AcadLedger's servers.
